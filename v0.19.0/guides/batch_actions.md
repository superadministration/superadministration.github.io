# Batch actions

Batch actions allows admins to make changes to many records with fewer clicks. To reduce repetitive tasks. For example, you might set up a batch action to delete multiple records at once, or to update the state of several orders. For example, an admin might be able to use a batch delete functionality to delete multiple records at once instead of pressing, waiting for the page to reload, and pressing the next one.

Batch actions might be a good fit for you if this workflow makes sense:

1. The developer defines one or many batch actions that the admin can use.
1. The admin optionally uses the filtering feature to find the records that they want to act on.
1. The admin presses a checkbox on all the records that they want to act on.
1. The admin runs the batch action.
1. The batch action does the same task on each of those selected records.
