# Super v0.18.0

Super's documentation is split up into three parts:

* The Tutorial shows you how to create a few realistic admin pages. This is a
  good place to start if you haven't used Super before
* The Guides go over various settings and customizations you can change once
  you're comfortable with Super's main features
* The API docs describe Super's public interface
